#!/bin/bash
# Installs Arca for the current user on Linux and macOS.
#
# No sudo by default: the binaries go to ~/.local/bin, which is what the
# freedesktop directory specification says and what macOS honours just the
# same. With --system they go to /usr/local/bin, and that does need
# privileges.
#
# There is no file manager integration here yet. On Windows it exists because
# the context menu is a COM DLL; the equivalent in Dolphin, Thunar, Nemo,
# Nautilus or Finder is a different mechanism in each case.
#
# Usage:  ./install.sh             install into ~/.local/bin
#         ./install.sh --system    install into /usr/local/bin
#         ./install.sh --uninstall remove it
