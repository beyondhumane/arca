//! One HTTPS request, made by the system.
//!
//! The only reason this crate exists is to ask a web address for a short piece
//! of text and hand it back. It is deliberately not a HTTP client: no methods
//! other than GET, no headers to set, no redirects followed, no cookies, no
//! streaming. What it does have is a ceiling on how much it will read, because
//! whatever is at the other end is not ours and a reply that never ends must
//! not be able to grow a window's memory without limit.
//!
//! On Windows it goes through WinHTTP, which is the machine's own client: its
//! list of trusted roots is the one Windows Update keeps current and the one
//! every other program here already trusts. Pulling in a HTTP crate instead
//! would have meant a TLS stack of several megabytes, with its own copy of
//! those roots to keep up to date, so that a program made of decompressors
//! could read a version number.
//!
//! Anywhere else it answers nothing at all, which the caller has to be ready
//! for anyway: no network, no reply, and a refusal from the machine all look
//! the same from here on purpose. Nothing this crate is used for is important
//! enough to explain itself.
