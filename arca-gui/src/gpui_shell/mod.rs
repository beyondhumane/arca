//! Opt-in GPUI surface for the G4.1 toolbar and navigation migration.
//!
//! This view translates user input into `AppAction`s. Archive work stays in
//! `AppController` workers; native file dialogs are bridged from a thread so
//! they never block GPUI's UI thread. The file table uses GPUI's virtualized
//! `uniform_list`; dialog state and overlays are rendered by GPUI, while native
//! file pickers stay on worker threads.
